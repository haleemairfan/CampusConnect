# **Campus Connect**


## **Project Description**
### Section 1: Motivation and Aims
Our application aims to address often-overlooked challenges university students encounter, such as academic, social and personal hurdles, which may come to feel overwhelming.
Our aim is to create a platform where students from different universities in Singapore can seek support and guidance through provision of their experiences, study tips and
academic advice tailored to their individual needs. This will be done by connecting students with other peers or alumni who have navigated similar challenges. Social connections
are thus fostered and students will no longer feel isolated as they know that they can seek help and support anytime through this application, promoting mental well-being and 
personal growth. Ultimately, our goal is to empower students to overcome obstacles, achieve their goals, and enjoy a fulfilling university experience within a
vibrant and inclusive community.

### Section 2: Campus Connect Features:
Our final application will consist of the following core and extension features:
1. Account Creation, Deletion and Updating (Core)
2. Option to Remain Anonymous (Core)
3. Post and Comment System (Core)
4. Direct Messaging System (Core)
5. Moderation of Users (Extension)
6. Display Configuration (Extension)
<br>

### Section 3: Tech Stack
Campus Connect will use a PERN stack as our main architecture to build a full-stack application with CRUD operations.
<br>
Frontend: **React Native** (responsible for our app's GUI)
<br>
Backend: **Express and Node.js** (building of our restful API and handling of HTTP requests and responses)
<br>
Database: **PostgreSQL** (database management system that is ACID compliant)
<br>

Above details how the different entities in the database are associated with each other by means of the Crow's feet notation. 
Most of the tables branch out from the Users table, with one user having multiple of other entities (e.g. multiple posts and comments).


## **Installation and Running**
Our project is still in progress, as such a completed system is still not completed. <br>
However, we currently have both the application code (React Native) and database code (PostgreSQL) up on our Github. 
Please download the files and take a look.
